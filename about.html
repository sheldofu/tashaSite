                            <p>Hi and welcome to my About Me page.  I’m Tasha, I live in South Petherton with my partner, Mike, our two cats, Hamilton and Nala, and the latest addition to the family, Luther the cocker spaniel puppy, who is growing fast.</p>

                            <h3>Experience</h3>
                            <p>I started my career working as an associate lecturer at a local college, teaching ‘A’ level and GCSE psychology.  <p>I found my interest lay with mental health and I made the decision to work within the NHS.  My first role was as a nursing assistant on a mental health inpatient unit before I moved to work in the community mental health team.  This gave me the opportunity to start working with people experiencing mental health difficulties in their own homes and in the community.  After more than 5 years in the NHS I moved to work for a mental health charity where I have been working for over 3 years.  <p>In my current role I coordinate a mental health outreach service, facilitate self-management training and work as a mentor with people referred through Somerset Partnership Talking Therapies Service.</p>
